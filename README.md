Module 21 Challenge. 

Overview of the analysis: The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  

Data Preprocessing.   
-What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? The target of the model is the column, "IS_SUCCESSFULL".  
-What variable(s) are the features for your model?  The features include application type, income amount, ask amount, and if there were special considerations.  
-What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? Two columns that were dropped were "EIN" & "NAME".  

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model.  
-How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? I selected 3 layers and used relu twice and and sigmoid for the 3rd one. Additionally, I had 80 and 30 neurons for the first two layers.
-Were you able to achieve the target model performance?  No, I was only able to get around 72% of the targeted 75% accuracy.
-What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?  I dropped the 'use_case' column, chnaged the cutoff value for application types to 600, and increased epochs to 200 in my model.

Summary: We were able to get very close, but not eclipse the 75% target accuracy. I would recommend giving trying a random forrest model or a balanced random forest model to see if we could improve the accuracy of the model.
